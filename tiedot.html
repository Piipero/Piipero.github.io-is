      <h2>About us</h2>

      <p class="bio">

        Immortal Souls was started by Esa and Aki Särkioja back in 1991. 
        Our current style evolved on Divine Wintertime –EP (1999) that became the first important recording. It was where everything started. First album Under the Northern Sky (2001) was a continuation to definition of our style. <br>
        <br>
        Ice Upon the Night was released in Europe 2003 and in US 2004. Because the earlier Immortal Souls publications had been sold out long time ago, they were published as remastered versions on the Once Upon A Time In The North 2 CD-compilation album at the end of 2005. 
        Dark Balance released our storybased concept album Wintereich in 2007. <br>
        <br>
        We made gigs around Finland, until 2002 we visited in Sweden. After that we have been touring in Scandinavia and Europe more or less regularly. Last tour was made in co-operation with Becoming the Archetype (US) in the fall 2011 after our latest album The Requiem for the Art of Death was released. 
        We also made our first music video of the third track Nuclear Winter in September 2011. <br>
        <br>
        Genre: Wintermetal / Melodic death metal <br>
        <br>
        
        Wintermetal was created in 2003, when we were finishing album Ice Upon the Night. All of our songs so far were tied with winter and nature and their beauty. We had the idea, that this music is actually Wintermetal, not just any death metal. 
        As later thought, it makes sense in every way. Our music is fast paced and highly melodic; like a winterwind at a beautiful frost morning, heavy and aggressive; as fierce as winter can be. And white purity of winter, which Aki has always used in the lyrics in allegories and hidden meanings between the lines. This is Wintermetal.
